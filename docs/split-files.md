# Split Files

Split files are stores as well-formed JSON and **must** contain one main object.

You can use splits located in [the resource repository](https://github.com/LibreSplit/LibreSplit-resources/tree/main/splits) to start creating your own split files and place them however you want.

## Main Object

| Key                 | Type               | Value                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`             | string             | Title string at top of window                       |
| `attempt_count`     | int                | Number of attempts                                  |
| `comparison_method` | int                | Method of comparison between real_time or game_time |
| `start_delay`       | string (timestamp) | Non-negative delay until timer starts               |
| `world_record`      | time               | Best known [time](#time-object)                     |
| `splits`            | array              | Array of [split objects](#split-object)             |
| `theme`             | string             | Window theme                                        |
| `theme_variant`     | string             | Window theme variant                                |
| `width`             | int                | Window width                                        |
| `height`            | int                | Window height                                       |

Most of the above keys are optional.
`comparison_method` determines which time is authoritative for determining things like PBs and best splits.
0 = real_time, 1 = game_time.

## Split Object

| Key            | Type   | Value                                                     |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`        | string | Split title                                               |
| `icon`         | string | Icon file path or url                                     |
| `time`         | time   | Split time - the total time up to this segment in your PB |
| `best_time`    | time   | Your best split time                                      |
| `best_segment` | time   | Your best segment time (split gold)                       |

## Time Object

| Key         | Type   | Value                                                             |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `real_time` | string | Real time elapsed for your run                                    |
| `game_time` | string | Game time elapsed for your run as controlled by your autosplitter |

A time object is an object containing times for real time and game time. Times in a time object are strings in `HH:MM:SS.mmmmmm` format.

Icons can be either a local file path (preferably absolute) or a URL. Note that only GTK-supported image formats will work.
Most common image formats like PNG and JPEG should work. Exact format support may vary by system.

## Example

Here is a quick example of how a simple split file would look:

```json
{
  "title": "School - Homework%",
  "attempt_count": 55,
  "comparison_method": 1,
  "splits": [
    {
      "title": "Maths",
      "time": {
        "real_time": "05:17:58.000000",
        "game_time": "05:12:55.000000"
      },
      "best_time": {
        "real_time": "04:14:38.000000",
        "game_time": "04:10:50.000000"
      },
      "best_segment": {
        "real_time": "04:14:38.000000",
        "game_time": "04:10:50.000000"
      }
    },
    {
      "title": "Science",
      "time": {
        "real_time": "07:45:10.000000",
        "game_time": "07:36:30.000000"
      },
      "best_time": {
        "real_time": "05:32:25.000000",
        "game_time": "05:26:25.000000"
      },
      "best_segment": {
        "real_time": "01:17:47.000000",
        "game_time": "01:15:35.000000"
      }
    }
  ],
  "width": 250,
  "height": 500
}
```

In the example above, the individual segment time for the "Maths" split would be `05:17:58.000000`, `05:12:55.000000` for real_time and game_time respectively
and the individual segment time for the "Science" split would be `02:27:12.000000`, `02:23:35.000000` for real_time and game_time respectively.
For the sake of the example, we assume the time it took between changing subjects is not timed in this hypothetical game's rules hence game_time is faster.
That difference is the difference between game_time and real_time as defined by the autosplitter.

game_time is controlled by the autosplitter. When an autosplitter does not define its own timing method, then game_time will mirror real_time - loading_time. The loading time is a state
that can be defined by an autosplitter. If none is provided then real_time - loading_time would just be real_time and thus game_time would be equivalent to real_time. This is for cases where
a game has no autosplitter at all for example.

Since this hypothetical example uses a `comparison_method` of game_time, it is possible for the `real_time` section of any of the splits to be slower than a prior
`real_time` value, since only `game_time` needs to be faster for you to record a gold or a PB.
